## Working at Evertune (NYC, 2025)

I work at **Evertune** as a software engineer in our **Flatiron, NYC** office.  
It’s fast, focused, and a genuinely fun place to build.  
Every day feels a little different. Some days are spent testing experiments or fixing strange bugs, others are full of quick conversations that somehow turn into new features before the day ends.  

The main thing that stands out is the trust.  
You get a lot of ownership over what you work on, and people trust you to figure things out.  
There’s no heavy management layer — everyone’s expected to take responsibility and keep moving.  
That freedom makes the work more meaningful.

## What Is Evertune

At a high level, **Evertune** helps people understand how AI systems see the web.  
We analyze how models like ChatGPT or Claude interpret, summarize, and reference information online.  

On the inside, though, it feels more like we’re mapping a new kind of search layer — one that sits between the web and AI models.  
The problems are new, the questions are open-ended, and the work blends engineering, data, and creativity in a way I haven’t experienced anywhere else.

Everything runs on a **modern tech stack** that’s clean and fast to work with.  
And AI isn’t just in the product — it’s part of how we build, test, and improve everything internally.  
It keeps things experimental but grounded.

## The Flatiron Office

The office is right in **Flatiron**, surrounded by coffee shops, noise, and that specific kind of New York energy that makes you want to do more.  
It’s a collaborative space — people jump in to help each other, ideas spread quickly, and feedback happens in real time.  

There’s no separation between departments here.  
Engineering works side-by-side with **data science, marketing, and sales**, and that mix keeps everyone aligned.  
If we ship a new feature, marketing knows exactly how to talk about it.  
If data finds something interesting, it loops back into the product the same day.  
It never feels like different teams — just one group working on the same big puzzle from different angles.

That’s what I like most about being in person here.  
You feel the momentum in the room — people bouncing ideas, checking results, sharing small wins.  
It’s fast, but it’s organized chaos in the best way.

## Masters of Their Craft

Everyone at Evertune is great at what they do.  
It’s not loud or showy — it’s quiet confidence.  
You’ll see engineers architecting clean systems, data scientists pulling insights out of massive datasets, and marketing and sales turning technical complexity into clear stories.  

What’s cool is that everyone respects each other’s expertise.  
There’s no ego about roles.  
You can sit in a meeting with someone from sales and genuinely learn something new about how users see the product.  
That level of openness keeps the whole company learning together.

Working around people who care that much about the details naturally makes you raise your own standards.  
You start to see your work as part of something bigger, not just code or tasks.

---

## The Pace

Things move fast here, but never recklessly.  
There’s a sense of urgency, but also balance.  
If an idea makes sense, it gets built. If it doesn’t, we test, measure, and iterate.  

The feedback loops are short, and you see results almost immediately.  
That’s one of the most satisfying parts — your work doesn’t disappear into a backlog.  
It goes live, gets used, and shapes what happens next.

## Learning From the Team

As one of the younger engineers here, I’ve learned more in a few months than I ever thought was possible.  
A lot of the team has experience scaling serious companies before, including places like **The Trade Desk**, **Adbrain**, and several others — and it shows.  

They think in systems, not just code.  
They explain things clearly, ask good questions, and give feedback that actually helps you grow.  
It’s not formal mentorship, but you end up learning constantly just by being part of the process.  

What I really appreciate, though, is how much room there is to bring your own ideas.  
I’ve had the chance to put my own vision into parts of the product — shaping features, improving small details, and testing ideas that started as quick sketches in my notebook.  
Seeing those ideas make it into production has been one of the most rewarding parts of the job.

## Building Without a Map

The best part about working here is that there’s no fixed blueprint.  
We’re building in a space that’s still taking shape.  
That means lots of experimentation, a few mistakes, and plenty of creative problem-solving.  

Everyone’s trying to figure out how AI really sees the world — and how we can measure that in a useful way.  
It’s challenging, but it’s also what makes the work feel new every single day.

## Closing Thoughts

Working at Evertune feels like being part of something small but serious.  
It’s ambitious, high-trust, and full of smart people who genuinely like solving hard problems together.  
There’s no “engineering vs. sales” here — it’s all one team.  
When something works, everyone celebrates. When something doesn’t, everyone fixes it.

For me, it’s the first job where software engineering feels bigger than just writing code.  
It feels like helping build a system that connects human information with how AI understands it — and doing it with people who actually care.

We’re hiring in **NYC** and **Seattle**, with a mix of in-office and hybrid roles.
